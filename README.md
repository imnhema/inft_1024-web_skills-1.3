## Overview
This repository contains the completed work for Part 1 of Assessment 1.3 for INFT 1024 Information Technology Fundamentals. This assessment demonstrates the application of HTML, CSS, and Git skills to style a web page and implement version control practices.

## Assessment Requirements

The assessment required completing the following tasks:

1. Create a GitHub repository and clone it to a local machine
2. Style a provided HTML page using CSS according to specific requirements
3. Make at least three detailed commits during the styling process
4. Push the repository to GitHub with proper documentation

## Styling Implementation

The styling requirements included:
- Setting background color of the page to `c-background-color`
- Setting background color of header and footer to `c-background-highlights`
- Configuring text colors for main, footer, and header to `base-font-color`
- Making links in the article `c-magenta` with orange highlights on hover
- Adding solid 3px `c-cyan` borders around article subsections
- Centering header text with 150% size and `c-yellow` color
- Removing bullet points from navigation lists

- Setting maximum page width to 800px
- Adding 50px top padding to article headings
- Arranging the layout for related links to appear to the right of the article

## Repository Structure

- `styled_page.html`: The main HTML file with the implemented styling

As required by the assessment, multiple commits were made during the development process, each following the specified format:
- First line: Summary of changes (under 72 characters)

## Tools Used

- HTML5 for document structure
